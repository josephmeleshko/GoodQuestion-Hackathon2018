"Name of the Game" game manual:

  "Name of the Game" is a make-your-own-adventure type platformer with an
  emphasis on the style of controls. The game is intended to teach people to
  think "Computationally". The controls of the game are done by our own language
  which works like a normal scripting programming language. Here is the
  explanation of the syntax of this language:

    build(x,y,ID): This is the most important command of the game. This command lets
    you build certain objects out of the materials that you have in a location of
    your choosing. You have to input the parameters in this order: x-Coordinate, 
    y-Coordinate, Object Identifier. Example: Build(7, 3, 1) This command call 
    should create a wooden block (Object ID of 1) in position (7,3) on the grid.

    destroy(x,y): This command lets you destroy any object that you have already
    placed by providing the location of the object on screen. Example: Destroy(2,4) 
    will destroy the block that you placed in that location in the previous example, 
    assuming that the block was still in that location.
    
    In the future, we intend to add more, such as for loops, arrays, and for each 
    loops, to name a few. There would also be new blocks with different functionality, 
    such as latters and launchers that we would develop new "code" for the editor.
    
  From the terminal, you have access to the following commands:

    Save: Not Yet Implemented 
    Saves the current game state in memory.

    Help: Not Yet Implemented
    Opens this file to show you all the commands available.

    List Levels: Not Yet Implemented
    Displays a list of all available levels for you to play on.

    change level(n): 
    This command switches the game level to the one that is
    specified within the brackets. Example: change level(1)

    Settings: Not Yet Implemented
    Displays a list of all changeable settings and their current state.

    change setting(): Not Yet Implemented. 
    Changes the setting specified as the first parameter in the
    brackets to the value of the second parameter in the brackets. The Parameters
    are separated by commas. Example: Change Setting(Terminal Colour, Black)

    start: 
    This command will start the current chosen level.

    quit: 
    This command will make the game quit.

    pause: 
    This command pauses the running of the game. When the game screen is
    paused you can still edit the environment, but your character simply won't
    move.

    continue: 
    This command will continue a paused game.

    change tickspeed(s): 
    This command dictates how quick the game runs. The argument s refers to the
    tickspeed. The larger the value of s, the more time between ticks, the slower
    the game will run.
